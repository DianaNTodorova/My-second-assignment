            Midsummer is normally an occasion of large gatherings âˆ’ and to be
            honest, many Swedes take advantage of it to fulfil their social
            obligations so that they can enjoy the rest of their holiday in
            peace.

            In many cases, whole families gather to celebrate this traditional
            high-point of the summer. The maypole is raised in an open spot and
            traditional ring-dances ensue, to the delight of the children and
            some of the adults. Teenagers tend to stay out of it and wait for
            the eveningâ€™s more riotous entertainment.

          Swedes like the world to be well-ordered, so Midsummer Eve is always a
          Friday between 19 and 25 June. People often begin the day by picking
          flowers and making wreaths to place on the maypole, which is a key
          component in the celebrations.

            Legend has it that the night before Midsummerâ€™s Day is a magical
            time for love. It still is, in a way. During this night many a
            relationship is put to the test. Under the influence of alcohol, the
            truth will out, which can lead both to marriage and to divorce.

            Like Whitsun, Midsummer is a popular time of year for weddings and
            christening ceremonies. Despite their poor showing as churchgoers in
            general, some Swedes still like to wed in a country church with a
            flower-bedecked, arched entrance and beautiful hymns.

            In agrarian times, Midsummer celebrations in Sweden were held to
            welcome summertime and the season of fertility. In some areas people
            dressed up as â€˜green menâ€™, clad in ferns. They also decorated their
            houses and farm tools with foliage, and raised tall, leafy maypoles
            to dance around, probably as early as the 1500s.

            Midsummer was primarily an occasion for young people, but it was
            also celebrated in the industrial communities of central Sweden,
            where all mill employees were given a feast of pickled herring, beer
            and schnapps. It was not until the 1900s, however, that this became
            the most Swedish of all traditional festivities.
